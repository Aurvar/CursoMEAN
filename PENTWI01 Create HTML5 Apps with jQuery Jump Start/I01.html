        <p>Want to know what exactly jQuery is and why it's so wildly popular? Get answers, and watch an exciting day of jQuery goodness hosted by Jeremy Foster and Rachel Appel, who teach you what it is, why you need it, and how you use it. (Spoiler alert:
          jQuery makes your dev work significantly easier, and it's inherently reactive!) <br /><br /> In this sixth <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/colleges/Web-Development-Wednesdays"> Web Wednesdays </a> event, learn about the history
          and contributors to jQuery, and explore lots of features. Find out how this JavaScript library makes DOM manipulation and event handling easier. Examine AJAX, asynchrony, and effects. Plus, get practical guidance on when to use jQuery and when
          to combine it with other libraries. <br /><br /><strong> Instructor </strong> | ? ? <a href="http://www.twitter.com/codefoster"> Jeremy Foster </a> - Microsoft Developer Evangelist?; <a href="http://www.twitter.com/RachelAppel"> Rachel Appel </a>          - Software Engineer, author, mentor, and international speaker</p>

      <p>Arguably the most powerful offering of jQuery over raw JavaScript, at least in the early days, was its ability to select one or more DOM elements using the popular CSS syntax. Take a look at this feature and how you can use it to select exactly
        what you need to manipulate.</p>
